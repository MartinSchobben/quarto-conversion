title: "Bug: conversion from ipynb to qmd removes first text cell(s)"
format: gfm
---

I noticed that text disappeared when converting a Jupyter Notebook to a Quarto Notebook. It appears to only happen to text cells that occur before the first code cell.

```{python}
!quarto --version
```

```{python}
!quarto check
```

To showcase this I will convert an `qmd` file to an `ipynb` file and back again. Check source files in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MartinSchobben/quarto-conversion/tree/main).

This is the starting point:

````
{{< include input-document.qmd >}}
````

```{python}
!quarto convert input-document.qmd
```


The output `ipynb` is as expected, see [here](https://github.com/MartinSchobben/quarto-conversion/blob/main/input-document.ipynb).

Here one can see that some text is missing when I now `convert` this back to a `qmd` file.


```{python}
!quarto convert input-document.ipynb --output output-document.qmd
```


````
{{< include output-document.qmd >}}
````
